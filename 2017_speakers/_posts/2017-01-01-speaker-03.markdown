topic: <br> Reward-based Learning and Decision Making &#58; Experiments & Models
description: Reinforcement learning provides a framework for making agents learn policies through feedback signals (“rewards”), which provide information about whether their actions or action sequences were successful or not. Reinforcement learning also provides a framework for understanding, how humans learn and decide given reward information only. Standard reinforcement learning assumes that good decisions / actions / policies are the ones which maximize expected reward as a proxy of success. Humans and animals, on the other hand, often do not behave this way, and there is ample evidence for multiple factors which influence learning and decision making. In my talk I will specifically discuss two additional sources influencing reward based learning and decision making in human subjects &#58; multiple prediction errors related to one learning task and the interaction between risk and reward. For the latter I will present a new mathematical framework for including risk into reinforcement learning on Markov decision processes, and I will derive a risk-sensitive variant of model-free Q-learning. Then I will discuss extensions of this framework to the partially observable case, which applies if decisions have to be made under perceptual uncertainty. <br><br> Klaus Obermayer received his Diplom degree in physics in 1987 from Universität Stuttgart, Germany, and the Dr. rer. nat. degree in 1992 from the Department of Physics, Technische Universität München, Germany.<br>From 1992 and 1993, he was a postdoctoral fellow at the Rockefeller University, New York, and the Salk Institute for Biological Studies, La Jolla, USA. From 1994 to 1995 he was member of the Technische Fakultät, Universität Bielefeld, Germany. He became associate professor in 1995 and full professor in 2001 at the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science of the Technische Universität Berlin, Germany. Currently, he is head of the Neural Information Processing Group and member of the steering committees of the Bernstein Center for Computational Neuroscience and the Einstein Center Neuroscience in Berlin. He was member of the governing board of the International Neural Network Society from 2004 - 2012 and Vice-President of the Organization for Computational Neuroscience from 2008 - 2011. In 2005 he was appointed Guest Professor at the Northwestern Polytechnic University, Xi’an, PR China. His current areas of research are computational neuroscience, artificial neural networks and machine learning, and the analysis of neural data. He co-authored more than 270 scientific publications.
