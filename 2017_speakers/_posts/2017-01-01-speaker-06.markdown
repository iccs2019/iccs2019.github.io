topic: The neural network of intentions in healthy and pathological people
description: I show how my research group empirically tested one of the most relevant topics in philosophy of mind through a series of fMRI experiments&#58; the nature of different types of intention. To this aim, firstly I trace a theoretical distinction among private, social, and communicative intentions. Then I propose a set of predictions concerning the recognition of these three types of intention in healthy individuals, and I report the experimental results corroborating our theoretical model of intentions. <br><br> The second question I face is whether intention processing is affected by the expressive means through which a communicative intention is conveyed, i.e., the linguistic or extralinguistic gestural means. Combined factorial and conjunction analyses are used to test two sets of predictions  first, that a common brain network is recruited for the comprehension of communicative intentions independently of the modality through which they are conveyed; second, that additional brain areas are specifically recruited depending on the communicative modality employed, reflecting distinct sensorimotor gateways. Our results show that a common neural network is engaged in communicative intention processing independently of the modality employed.<br><br>Third, being able to comprehend communicative intentions and to recognize whether such intentions are directed toward us or not is extremely important in social interaction. Two brain systems, the mentalizing and the mirror neuron system, have been proposed to underlie intention recognition. Categorical and functional connectivity analyses show that both systems contribute to the encoding of communicative intentions and that both systems are significantly stronger activated and more strongly coupled when communicative actions are directed toward ourselves.<br><br>Finally, I derive from our model predictions relevant for the domain of psychopathological functioning. In particular, I treat the cases of both hyper-intentionality (as in paranoid schizophrenia) and hypo-intentionality (as in autistic spectrum disorders). My conclusion is that the theoretical model of intention I propose contributes to enlarge our knowledge on the neurobiological bases of intention processing, in both healthy people and in people with impairments to the neurocognitive system that underlies intention recognition.
