topic: <br> Magnifying time &#58; Examining the Multimodal Microdynamics of Parent-Child Interaction and Early Word Learning
description: Interacting embodied agents, be they groups of adult humans engaged in a coordinated task, autonomous robots acting in an environment, or a mother teaching a child, must seamlessly coordinate their actions to achieve a collaborative goal. Inter-agent coordination depends crucially on external behaviors by the participants where the behavior of one participant organizes the actions of the other in real time. In this talk, I will review a set of studies using a novel experimental paradigm in which we collect high-density multimodal behavioral data (including eye tracking, motion tracking, audio and video) in both parent-child and human-robot interactions. We compare and analyze the dynamic structure of free-flowing parent-child and human-robot interactions in the context of language learning, and discover the characteristics of the learning agentâ€™s perceptual, attentional and motor systems in such interactions, and as well as perceptual and motor patterns that are informatively time-locked to words and their intended referents and predictive of word learning. I will conclude by discussing how high-density micro-level behaviors data lead to tangible opportunities in understanding human cognitive systems and in building artificial intelligence systems.  <br> <br> Chen Yu is a professor in the Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences, the Cognitive Science Program and  the School of Informatics, Computing and Engineering, at Indiana University, where he directs the Computational Cognition and Learning Lab. His research focuses on using head-mounted eye tracking, computational modeling and data mining techniques to understand the mechanisms of human learning, development and communication. He received the 2003 David Marr Best Paper Award from the Cognitive Science Society, the 2008 Early Career Award from the International Society on Infant Studies, and the 2013 Robert L. Fantz Memorial Award from American Psychological Foundation. He is fellow of Association of Psychological Science and Psychonomic Society. He has served in several NIH study sessions and NSF review panels. He is author of over 100 scientific articles.
