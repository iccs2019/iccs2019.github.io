description: Dr. James Anderson is a pioneer of neural networks and connectionist AI (Ersatz Brain Project). <br><br> He has written or co-written seven books, including Introduction to Neural Networks. Anderson studies how brains and computers are different in the way they compute, with a focus on neural networks. Recently, he has been working on a set of models of the intermediate-level organization of the nervous system, and the scaling of computational systems. <br><br> His talk will put recent Artificial Intelligence in a historical perspective and discuss ways we can extend and enhance the current fascination with deep learning. He will bring some of his work on arithmetic as an example of a different kind of  "brain-like computation."
