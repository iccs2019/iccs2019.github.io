topic: The Tactile Dimension of Cognition &#58; from Humans to Robots and Back 
description: We are living in a time where parallel advances in mechatronics, machine learning and the creation of huge databases allow us to bring together a critical set of capabilities to replicate or even surpass human skills in non-trivial domains. ombining recent advances in computer vision, speech understanding, trajectory planning and navigation allows to create robots that can move autonomously, perform a range of useful physical tasks and even interact with people in a way that appears communicative and social. However, so far these systems lack most of our human skills to cope with sophisticated physical contact of the kind that is typical of almost all of our daily manual actions.<br><br> A major reason for this is that robot tactile sensing is by far not yet on par with available robot vision. Moreover, while vision can occur without mechanical interaction, touch is inseparably interwined with control of physical contact and thus inherently dynamic and active. Humans take many years to develop their manual skills, developing a degree of "manual intelligence" that so far is almost entirely absent in current robots. The talk reviews some of the challenges that we need to solve to bring robots closer to human manual and haptic skills and provides examples of recent approaches. These include development of novel tactile sensors, analyzing human haptic exploration and search patterns, machine learning for tactile processing, tactile-based exploration of objects through robot hands, and the combination of touch and vision to manipulate objects. Finally, we discuss the role of touch for creating cognition that is grounded in interactions with the physical world and for building robots that can physically interact in natural and safe ways with humans and that are easy to integrate into society. <br><br><b>Short Bio of Helge Ritter</b>&#58; Helge Ritter studied Mathematics and Physics at the Universities of Bayreuth and Heidelberg and obtained a PhD in Theoretical Physics at TU Munich in 1988. After research stays at Helsinki University of Technology and at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign(USA) he joined the Faculty of Technology at Bielefeld University where he is leading the Neuroinformatics Group. <br> Helge Ritter's main interests are principles of neural computation and, in particular, self-organising and learning systems, and their application to robot control, manual intelligence, machine vision, data analysis and interactive human-machine interfaces. He has authored or co-authored numerous papers in these fields.<br>In 1999 Helge Ritter was awarded the SEL Alcatel research prize and in 2001 the Leibniz Prize of the German Science Foundation. He is a member of the Scientific Advisory Council of the Bielefeld Center for Interdiciplinary Research - ZiF, the Faculty of the Parmenides Foundation at Munich, the Scientific Advisory Board of the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems Tubingen, the North Rhine Westfalian Academy of Sciences, the Senate of the German Science Foundation DFG, and the German Academy of Science and Engineering (acatech). He has been a founding member and Director of the Institute for Cognition and Robotics (CoR-Lab) and since 2007 he is Coordinator of the Excellence Cluster Cognitive Interaction Technology at Bielefeld University.
