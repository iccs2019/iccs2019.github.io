topic: <br> Qualitative Representations &#58; How People Reason and Learn about the Continuous World
description: How people reason about the continuous world around us is one of the central mysteries of cognitive science. In everyday physical reasoning, for example, we think about quantities like temperature, pressure, and mass, and harness processes to cook and manufacture things.  In everyday social reasoning, we think about degrees of responsibility for events and how much two people like or trust each other.  This talk argues that the concepts of qualitative representations developed in AI research provide a robust cognitive model for such reasoning.      They provide four things &#58; (1) a bridge between perception and cognition, (2) a basis for commonsense reasoning, (3) a foundation for expert reasoning, and (4) a component of natural language semantics.  Moreover, I will argue that analogy is heavily used in learning and reasoning with qualitative representations.  These ideas will be illustrated by cognitive simulations of visual problem solving, conceptual change, natural language understanding, and moral decision-making. <br> <br> Kenneth D. Forbus is the Walter P. Murphy Professor of Computer Science and Professor of Education at Northwestern University.  He received his degrees from MIT (Ph.D. in 1984). His research interests include qualitative reasoning, analogical reasoning and learning, spatial reasoning, sketch understanding, natural language understanding, cognitive architecture, reasoning system design, intelligent educational software, and the use of AI in interactive entertainment.  He is a Fellow of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence, the Cognitive Science Society, and the Association for Computing Machinery.  He is the inaugural recipient of the Herbert A. Simon Prize, a recipient of the Humboldt Research Award and served as Chair of the Cognitive Science Society.
